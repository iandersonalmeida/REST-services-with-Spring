# REST services with Spring
Building a Restful service that addresses concepts of REST, MVC architecture and HATEOAS.

# Description
The developed application is a hypertext oriented payroll service; that is, the application must have links to other resources. <br> Thus, for the service to be Restful, it is necessary to add hypermedia that contains links to other types of media such as images, videos and text. <br> For this, HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) was used, which is a restriction of the REST architecture. <br>

With the MVC architecture, especially the controller, and the client-server architecture, the controller, <br> which operates on the server side, handles requests and returns JSON representations of resources. <br>

Each line of code was commented with the aim of learning and reusing the concepts.
